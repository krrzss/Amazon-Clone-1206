# Amazon Clone Project
In this project, I built a functional Amazon clone using HTML and CSS, demonstrating my understanding of web development and responsive design. The primary focus was on creating a visually appealing, well-structured, and user-friendly interface that mirrors the essence of the original platform.
ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings & Challenges
- # Flexbox Mastery:
- Flexbox became a crucial tool in structuring page layouts efficiently. I deepened my understanding of its properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap to ensure responsiveness.
- # Debugging & Problem-Solving:
- I learned how even small errorsâ€”such as incorrect CSS syntax or misplaced div tagsâ€”could cause major layout distortions. Debugging and refining my code was an essential part of the process.
- # UI & UX Enhancement:
- To improve the user experience, I focused on maintaining consistency in typography, color schemes, and spacing, making the design visually compelling and intuitive.
- # Responsive Design Techniques:
-  Ensuring the site adapts across different screen sizes was a challenge. I tackled this using media queries, flexbox, and relative units like % and vh.
- # Clean & Maintainable Code:
-  Throughout the development, I maintained structured and readable code by following best practices, using comments effectively, and keeping styles organized in a separate CSS file.
# ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
This project not only strengthened my technical abilities but also enhanced my problem-solving skills. It gave me a deeper appreciation for how real-world platforms are built and maintained. I'm excited to apply these learnings to future projects and continuously improve as a web developer.
